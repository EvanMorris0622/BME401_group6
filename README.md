This script uses the National Instruments DAQ  session interface to record joystick position data and send reward triggers to the DC motor infusion pump. 

The first section of the script includes variables that can be modified, depending upon the specific needs of the experiment. 

The .ipt files are for CAD files used to print pieces of the pump and joystick/holder
